Question)What is JIT?
Answer-JIT known as Just In Time.It is a program its use is that it converts bytecode into instructions, and this instruction can be directly passed to the processor.
It comes with virtual machine and  is used optionally .JVM executes one code at a time SO the execution process is slow or takes lot of time  but JIT recompiles 
these bytecode into a particular sysatem code. Initally these code is compiled by the compiler and when these code is re-compiled by JIT it run more faster.
